      'Holi, the festival of colors, is one of Hinduism\'s most joyous celebrations. But beyond the colors and festivities lies a deep spiritual significance rooted in ancient scripture.',

        heading: 'The Legend of Prahlad and Holika',
        text: 'The story of Holi begins with the demon king Hiranyakashipu, who forbade the worship of Lord Vishnu in his kingdom. Yet his own son, Prahlad, remained an unwavering devotee of Vishnu. Enraged, Hiranyakashipu ordered his sister Holika — who possessed a boon that made her immune to fire — to sit in a bonfire with Prahlad on her lap. By divine grace, Prahlad emerged unscathed while Holika, who misused her boon for evil, perished in the flames. This is why we light bonfires the night before Holi, a ritual called Holika Dahan, celebrating the victory of devotion over arrogance.',

        text: 'Holi is also deeply associated with the divine love of Radha and Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna, feeling self-conscious about his dark complexion compared to the fair-skinned Radha, asked his mother Yashoda why Radha was so much lighter. Mother Yashoda playfully suggested he color Radha\'s face with whatever color he wished. Krishna did exactly that, and from this playful act was born the tradition of smearing colors. In the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh — the land of Krishna\'s childhood — Holi is celebrated for weeks, with the joy and abandon of the divine.',

        text: 'On a deeper level, Holi represents the dissolution of ego. When we smear color on each other, social barriers — of caste, class, age, and status — dissolve for that moment. We are all one, drenched in the same joy. The colors themselves hold meaning: red symbolizes love and fertility, yellow represents prosperity and turmeric\'s sacred qualities, green stands for new beginnings and nature, and blue is the divine color of Lord Krishna himself. Playing Holi is, in essence, an act of spiritual surrender — letting go of pretense and celebrating the pure joy of existence.',

        text: 'On the eve of Holi, families gather around the Holika Dahan bonfire, perform prayers, and walk around the fire seeking blessings. The next morning begins with applying gulal (natural powder colors) on loved ones with the greeting "Happy Holi!" Traditional prasad includes gujiya (sweet dumplings), thandai, and mathri. Most importantly, use natural, herbal colors wherever possible — our skin and our environment both benefit. And remember: the truest celebration of Holi is to forgive old grudges and embrace everyone with open hearts, just as Prahlad\'s devotion opened the heart of the universe.',

    excerpt:
      'Among all Hindu rituals performed in homes, the Satyanarayan Katha is perhaps the most beloved. Families perform it to mark auspicious occasions and invite the blessings of Lord Vishnu in his form as Satyanarayan — the eternal truth.',

        heading: 'Who Is Lord Satyanarayan?',
        text: 'Satyanarayan is a form of Lord Vishnu — the Preserver of the Universe. The name comes from "Satya" (eternal truth) and "Narayan" (the one who abides in all living beings). In this form, the Lord appears to devotees as the embodiment of pure truth and divine benevolence. Unlike elaborate temple ceremonies, the Satyanarayan Puja is designed to be performed in the home, bringing sanctity to one\'s own living space. It is found in the Skanda Purana and has been practiced for centuries across all regions of India.',

        heading: 'When Should One Perform It?',
        text: 'Traditionally, Satyanarayan Katha is performed on Purnima (the full moon day), on auspicious Thursdays (Brihaspativar), or to mark special life events: a new home, a wedding, the birth of a child, the start of a new business venture, or the safe return from travel. The Katha can also be performed as an expression of gratitude for prayers answered. There is no "wrong" time to invite the grace of Satyanarayan — any moment of sincere devotion is auspicious.',

        heading: 'The Five Chapters of the Katha',
        text: 'The Satyanarayan Katha is divided into five chapters (Adhyayas), each telling the story of a different devotee whose life was transformed by the Lord\'s grace. From the poor Brahmin who became wealthy, to the woodcutter, to King Tungadhwaja who suffered for neglecting the prasad — each story drives home the same message: sincerity of heart and faithfulness in devotion are always rewarded, while pride and negligence lead to suffering. The stories are simple yet deeply moving, designed for all ages and backgrounds to understand and internalize.',

        text: 'One of the most distinctive aspects of Satyanarayan Puja is its prasad — a sweet semolina halwa (sheera) made with ghee, sugar, banana, and milk, also called "Panchamrit Prasad." The Katha specifically warns against dishonoring or refusing this prasad: in one of its stories, a king suffers great loss after his pride causes him to disrespect the Lord\'s offering. When the prasad is received with folded hands and eaten with gratitude, it carries the Lord\'s blessings into one\'s home and body. The prasad is a reminder that grace is not an abstract concept — it is tangible, delicious, and right in your hands.',

        text: 'Vastu Shastra (literally "science of dwelling") is an ancient Hindu system of architecture and spatial arrangement that dates back thousands of years, found in texts like the Arthashastra and the Manasara. It describes how the orientation of rooms, the flow of natural light, the placement of doors and kitchens, and even the direction one sleeps can influence the health, wealth, and harmony of the family within. The eight compass directions each correspond to a cosmic force, governed by different deities: East by Indra (prosperity), North by Kuber (wealth), South by Yama (discipline), and so on.',

        text: 'The Vastu Shanti puja is a Havan (sacred fire ritual) performed to purify the land and the home, appease the energies of all eight directions, and invoke the blessings of Vastu Purush — the cosmic being who presides over the dwelling space. The priest performs rituals in each corner of the house, offering prayers to the presiding deity of each direction. A Kalash (sacred pot) is filled with water, holy leaves, and grains and placed in the center of the space. The fire ceremony burns away negative energies and establishes the home as a sacred, protected space.',

        text: 'Every new space comes with its own energy — shaped by the land\'s history, the construction process, and the intentions embedded in the building. Vastu Shanti serves as a reset and a blessing: it cleanses these residual energies, sets a positive intention for the space, and asks the divine to guard the home and all who live within it. Families who have performed Vastu Shanti often report a palpable sense of peace and positivity in their new home. Whether or not one subscribes to the literal interpretation of Vastu, the act of beginning a new chapter with prayer, gratitude, and community is profoundly meaningful.',

        text: 'Vastu Shanti is a beginning, not an end. After the puja, there are simple practices to maintain positive energy in your home: keep the Northeast corner clean and lit with a diya regularly (this is the Ishan corner, associated with divine energy); ensure your main entrance is welcoming and free of clutter; place a Tulsi plant in your courtyard or balcony; and avoid storing broken items or unused junk, which invite stagnant energy. Lighting a diya in the evening, reciting prayers, and maintaining cleanliness are themselves daily acts of Vastu alignment — keeping your home a place where the divine feels welcome.',
