      "heading": "Who Is Lord Satyanarayan?",
      "text": "Satyanarayan is a form of Lord Vishnu — the Preserver of the Universe. The name comes from \"Satya\" (eternal truth) and \"Narayan\" (the one who abides in all living beings). In this form, the Lord appears to devotees as the embodiment of pure truth and divine benevolence. Unlike elaborate temple ceremonies, the Satyanarayan Puja is designed to be performed in the home, bringing sanctity to one's own living space. It is found in the Skanda Purana and has been practiced for centuries across all regions of India."

      "heading": "When Should One Perform It?",
      "text": "Traditionally, Satyanarayan Katha is performed on Purnima (the full moon day), on auspicious Thursdays (Brihaspativar), or to mark special life events: a new home, a wedding, the birth of a child, the start of a new business venture, or the safe return from travel. The Katha can also be performed as an expression of gratitude for prayers answered. There is no \"wrong\" time to invite the grace of Satyanarayan — any moment of sincere devotion is auspicious."

      "heading": "The Five Chapters of the Katha",
      "text": "The Satyanarayan Katha is divided into five chapters (Adhyayas), each telling the story of a different devotee whose life was transformed by the Lord's grace. From the poor Brahmin who became wealthy, to the woodcutter, to King Tungadhwaja who suffered for neglecting the prasad — each story drives home the same message: sincerity of heart and faithfulness in devotion are always rewarded, while pride and negligence lead to suffering. The stories are simple yet deeply moving, designed for all ages and backgrounds to understand and internalize."

    {
      "heading": "The Prasad: Sheera (Panchamrit Prasad)",
      "text": "One of the most distinctive aspects of Satyanarayan Puja is its prasad — a sweet semolina halwa (sheera) made with ghee, sugar, banana, and milk, also called \"Panchamrit Prasad.\" The Katha specifically warns against dishonoring or refusing this prasad: in one of its stories, a king suffers great loss after his pride causes him to disrespect the Lord's offering. When the prasad is received with folded hands and eaten with gratitude, it carries the Lord's blessings into one's home and body. The prasad is a reminder that grace is not an abstract concept — it is tangible, delicious, and right in your hands."
