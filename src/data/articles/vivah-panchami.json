  "excerpt": "Somewhere in Mithila, on the fifth day of Margasira's bright fortnight, Ram placed a garland around Sita's neck. The wedding lasted a few days. The story it began has lasted millennia — and is still being sung, still being danced, still being performed in village squares and royal theatres across the world. Vivah Panchami is the anniversary of a marriage the universe decided to remember.",

      "text": "King Janaka of Mithila had made a vow: only the man who could string the great bow of Shiva — which had been in his family's keeping since the time of the gods — would marry his daughter Sita. The bow was not merely large. It was Shiva's own weapon, so heavy that it required a cart pulled by five thousand men just to move it into the assembly hall. King after king, prince after prince had come and failed to even lift it. When the young Ram — barely out of his gurukul, still a student accompanying his teacher Vishwamitra on a different errand entirely — entered the assembly hall and saw the bow, he looked at his teacher for permission. Vishwamitra nodded. Ram walked to the bow, picked it up with his left hand, strung it, and drew it back so fully that it snapped in two. The sound of the bow breaking was heard across the three worlds, and the wedding was arranged before the echoes died."

      "heading": "The Swayamvara and What It Meant for Sita",
      "text": "Sita's swayamvara — her self-choice ceremony — is unique in the Ramayana tradition for how little it resembles a typical swayamvara. In most such ceremonies (as in Draupadi's in the Mahabharata), the woman walks among assembled princes and places a garland on the one she chooses. Sita does not choose this way — the bow chooses. And yet the tradition consistently presents Sita's outcome as a genuine choice. Sita had, since childhood, revered an image of Ram that she had seen in a dream or vision — a premonition, a recognition of the soul she was destined to meet. When she saw Ram in her father's court, she recognized him immediately. The lifting of the bow was for her father's requirement. The choice of the heart had already been made. This detail — the soul recognizing its partner before the formal event — is one the tradition finds deeply significant. Vivah Panchami celebrates not only a wedding but the moment recognition precedes ceremony."

      "heading": "The Wedding in Mithila and the Return to Ayodhya",
      "text": "The wedding of Ram and Sita was followed by the marriages of his three brothers: Lakshmana to Urmila (Sita's sister), Bharata to Mandavi, and Shatrughna to Shrutakirti — all in the same ceremony. The Valmiki Ramayana describes the celebration with unusual warmth and specificity: the music, the flowers, the exchange of garlands, the sacred fire, the seven circumambulations, the gifts exchanged between the royal families. The procession returning to Ayodhya was met on the road by Parashurama — the fierce warrior-sage who had always considered himself the greatest wielder of Vishnu's power — who challenged Ram with a second divine bow. Ram accepted, revealed his full divine identity to Parashurama, and the old sage stepped aside, humbled and liberated. The wedding journey home was itself an adventure. Their entire life together would be."

      "heading": "Why This Wedding Is Sung For Centuries",
      "text": "The Ram-Sita wedding has been performed on stage in Ram Lilas and theatrical traditions across the subcontinent for at least five hundred years. It is the subject of folk songs sung by women during weddings in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Nepal — songs called 'Banna' and 'Banni' that compare the bride and groom to Sita and Ram. It is painted on walls, embroidered on fabrics, carved in temples. Why does this specific wedding endure with such power? Perhaps because Ram and Sita's union is presented in the Ramayana as the union of complementary qualities rather than competing egos: Ram is Maryada (propriety, restraint, duty), and Sita is Shakti (strength, endurance, unwavering self-knowledge). Their marriage is, in the tradition's reading, the marriage of discipline with power — and the Ramayana is the exploration of what happens when that union is tested by the most extreme possible circumstances."

      "heading": "Observing Vivah Panchami",
      "text": "Vivah Panchami is most grandly celebrated in Janakpur, Nepal — the city believed to be the ancient Mithila where the wedding took place. The wedding is re-enacted with an elaborate procession, thousands of devotees, and the full ceremony. In Ayodhya, idols of Ram and Sita are dressed as bride and groom and taken in procession. At home, the day is observed with a simple puja to Ram and Sita together — the couple is always worshipped together, not separately — with the reading of the wedding episode from the Ramayana or Ramcharitmanas. The day is also considered auspicious for newly engaged couples to seek Ram and Sita's blessing on their own upcoming union. There is something quietly beautiful about asking the blessing of a couple whose own marriage knew every possible difficulty and yet remains, across millennia, the standard by which devotion and partnership are measured."
