  "date": "February 21, 2026",
  "excerpt": "There are twenty-four Ekadasis in a year, and each one carries its own significance. But there is one that stands above all the others — not in mythology, not in ritual complexity, but in sheer physical austerity. Nirjala Ekadasi is the fast where you eat nothing, drink nothing, from sunrise to the next morning's sunrise. And the tradition says it is worth all twenty-three others combined.",

      "text": "Ekadasi — the eleventh tithi of each lunar fortnight — is one of the most widely observed fasting days in the Vaishnava tradition. There are two Ekadasis every month: one in the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) and one in the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha), giving twenty-four Ekadasis per year (and occasionally twenty-five in a leap year). Each is named and carries its own story, its own patron deity or avatar, its own particular merit. The observance of Ekadasi is detailed at length in the Padma Purana, which lists the specific benefits of each one. The common thread across all of them is simple: on Ekadasi, you eat lightly or not at all, you redirect the time and energy usually spent on food and digestion toward prayer, reading, and contemplation, and you honor Vishnu — specifically his awakening or sleeping state. But most people who observe Ekadasi observe some of the twenty-four, not all. Which is why Bhima Ekadasi — the Nirjala Ekadasi — became what it is."

      "heading": "Bhima's Question and the Answer That Created a Festival",
      "text": "The origin story of Nirjala Ekadasi involves Bhima, the second Pandava — the most physically powerful of the five brothers. When the sage Vyasa explained the full significance of Ekadasi vrat to the Pandavas, all four other brothers and their wife Draupadi resolved to observe every Ekadasi with full sincerity. Bhima listened in agony. He knew his own nature: he had an extraordinarily powerful digestive fire (Vrikodara — he who has the fire of a wolf in his belly) and could not go even a few hours without eating. The prospect of twenty-four fasts a year was, for him, genuinely impossible — not laziness, not lack of devotion, but a physiological reality. He went to Vyasa and explained his dilemma. Could he somehow receive the merit of all twenty-four Ekadasis without being able to fast on each one? Vyasa considered and said: yes. One fast — the Ekadasi in the bright fortnight of Jyestha, in the peak of summer's heat, without food or water from sunrise to the next sunrise. One perfect fast. The merit of all twenty-four."

      "heading": "The Jyestha Summer and Why This Day Is Chosen",
      "text": "It is not an accident that the most demanding Ekadasi falls in Jyestha — the height of the North Indian summer, when temperatures reach their peak and the idea of going without water for twenty-four hours in the heat is genuinely daunting. The tradition does not ask this of the weak, the elderly, the sick, or pregnant women — the texts explicitly say that these individuals should observe a lighter form. For everyone else who is physically capable, the austerity is precisely the point. Fasting in winter, when the body is insulated and appetite is manageable, is one kind of practice. Fasting in the crushing heat of a Jyestha afternoon, when every cell in your body is asking for water, is another kind entirely. The tradition holds that it is in that specific moment of extreme physical want — when the body has pulled out every argument it has — that the mind has the opportunity to demonstrate who is actually in charge."

      "heading": "What the Fast Actually Does",
      "text": "The Ayurvedic understanding of Ekadasi fasting is that the eleventh day of each lunar fortnight corresponds to a natural ebb in the digestive system's energy — a period when the body is physiologically primed to rest from digestion and redirect its resources toward cleansing and repair. Observing Ekadasi is, from this perspective, working with the body's own lunar rhythm rather than against it. The specific waterless fast of Nirjala Ekadasi takes this further: without any liquid to prompt digestion, the system undergoes a much deeper cleanse. Modern researchers studying religious fasting have noted that the Ekadasi schedule — twice-monthly abstention from grains and often all food — aligns with contemporary research on periodic fasting's benefits for cellular renewal. The tradition arrived at this schedule not through biochemistry but through observation and revelation. The outcome is the same."

      "heading": "Breaking the Fast and the Gift of Water",
      "text": "Nirjala Ekadasi ends at sunrise on Dvadasi (the twelfth tithi) with a careful breaking of the fast. Tradition holds that the first thing consumed should be water — offered first in puja and then drunk. Many families make it a practice to give water, buttermilk, and fruit to passersby on Dvadasi morning, especially near temple steps. In a summer this severe, giving cold water to a thirsty stranger is understood as an act of giving life itself. The Padma Purana says that a devotee who observes Nirjala Ekadasi with full sincerity and then gives water to those in need on Dvadasi will never thirst — in this life or the next. The fast is not an end in itself. It creates a surplus — of discipline, of gratitude, of humility — and the surplus, the tradition says, is meant to be given away."
