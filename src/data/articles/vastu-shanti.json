      "heading": "What Is Vastu Shastra?",
      "text": "Vastu Shastra (literally \"science of dwelling\") is an ancient Hindu system of architecture and spatial arrangement that dates back thousands of years, found in texts like the Arthashastra and the Manasara. It describes how the orientation of rooms, the flow of natural light, the placement of doors and kitchens, and even the direction one sleeps can influence the health, wealth, and harmony of the family within. The eight compass directions each correspond to a cosmic force, governed by different deities: East by Indra (prosperity), North by Kuber (wealth), South by Yama (discipline), and so on."

      "heading": "What Happens During Vastu Shanti?",
      "text": "The Vastu Shanti puja is a Havan (sacred fire ritual) performed to purify the land and the home, appease the energies of all eight directions, and invoke the blessings of Vastu Purush — the cosmic being who presides over the dwelling space. The priest performs rituals in each corner of the house, offering prayers to the presiding deity of each direction. A Kalash (sacred pot) is filled with water, holy leaves, and grains and placed in the center of the space. The fire ceremony burns away negative energies and establishes the home as a sacred, protected space."

      "heading": "Why Is It Important for a New Home or Office?",
      "text": "Every new space comes with its own energy — shaped by the land's history, the construction process, and the intentions embedded in the building. Vastu Shanti serves as a reset and a blessing: it cleanses these residual energies, sets a positive intention for the space, and asks the divine to guard the home and all who live within it. Families who have performed Vastu Shanti often report a palpable sense of peace and positivity in their new home. Whether or not one subscribes to the literal interpretation of Vastu, the act of beginning a new chapter with prayer, gratitude, and community is profoundly meaningful."

      "heading": "Tips to Maintain Vastu Balance After the Puja",
      "text": "Vastu Shanti is a beginning, not an end. After the puja, there are simple practices to maintain positive energy in your home: keep the Northeast corner clean and lit with a diya regularly (this is the Ishan corner, associated with divine energy); ensure your main entrance is welcoming and free of clutter; place a Tulsi plant in your courtyard or balcony; and avoid storing broken items or unused junk, which invite stagnant energy. Lighting a diya in the evening, reciting prayers, and maintaining cleanliness are themselves daily acts of Vastu alignment — keeping your home a place where the divine feels welcome."
