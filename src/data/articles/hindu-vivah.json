      "text": "At the center of every Hindu wedding burns Agni — the sacred fire. Agni is not decoration. He is the primary witness (Sakshi) of the marriage: the one before whom all vows are spoken, all intentions revealed. In the Rigveda, Agni is described as Vishvaveda — the one who knows everything — because fire holds nothing back and conceals nothing. When a couple circles the fire together and speaks their vows into its heat and light, they do so in the understanding that something eternal is bearing witness. Unlike a legal contract signed on paper, the vows of a Hindu Vivah are spoken into an element that cannot be forged, bribed, or conveniently \"lost.\" Ancient lawyers could not have designed a more incorruptible notary."

      "heading": "The Saptapadi: Seven Steps, Seven Promises",
      "text": "The Saptapadi — the seven circumambulations of the sacred fire — is the legal and spiritual heart of the Hindu marriage. It is the moment the couple becomes husband and wife in the eyes of Hindu law. With each step, a specific vow is taken: the first step is for food and nourishment (\"I will provide for you\"), the second for strength and righteous living, the third for wealth and prosperity, the fourth for happiness and children, the fifth for the welfare of all creatures, the sixth for the enjoyment of all seasons, and the seventh — the most binding of all — is for eternal friendship. That seventh step is the one that makes the marriage permanent: once the seventh Phera is complete, the union is considered indissoluble. Everything before it — the rituals, the fire, the music — has led to this quiet, walking vow."

      "heading": "Kanyadaan: The Most Misunderstood Ritual",
      "text": "Few wedding rituals generate more conversation today than Kanyadaan — the \"giving of the daughter.\" Critics, understandably, object to the idea of a daughter being \"given\" like an object. But the Sanskrit reveals something more nuanced. \"Kanya\" is not merely \"daughter\" — it is also a specific word for a pure, auspicious being. And \"Daan\" in Hindu thought is not gift-giving in the transactional sense; it is a sacred act of releasing attachment to something precious. When a father performs Kanyadaan, the Vedic mantras he recites are not claiming to transfer ownership of a person. They say: \"I release my attachment to this beloved soul. I trust her to her own path and to this new family. May she be joyful.\" The ritual is a father's act of letting go — and any parent who has watched their child leave home knows there is nothing trivial about it."

      "heading": "The Stars Are Watching Too",
      "text": "The wedding muhurta — the auspicious time chosen by the Jyotishi — is not arbitrary. In Vedic astrology, the moment of the Saptapadi is considered the \"birth\" of the marriage itself, much as the moment of physical birth determines an individual's horoscope. The planetary positions at that exact moment shape the energy of the union going forward. This is why Hindu weddings can happen at 2 AM or at dawn — the muhurta is chosen by the stars, not by the convenience of the catering hall. Additionally, a ritual called Nakshatra Darshan is often performed on the wedding night: the couple together looks at the star Arundhati (Alcor in the Mizar system), a star so closely bound to its companion that it is visible only through perfect alignment — a marriage of stars used as a model for the marriage of souls."

    {
      "heading": "A Wedding That Lasts Seven Lifetimes",
      "text": "The Hindu marriage is not \"till death do us part.\" According to the tradition, the Saptapadi binds two souls for seven lifetimes. This is not a burden — it is a recognition that the kind of love being invoked here is not a contract between two individuals in a single moment in history, but a thread that has already been woven across many lives. The couple performing their pheras today has, in the Vedic worldview, been drawn together by something that began long before this wedding, in some previous meeting, some karmic thread finally tied into a knot around a sacred fire. The ceremony does not begin the relationship. It simply names what has always been true."
