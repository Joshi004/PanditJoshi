      "text": "The story of Holi begins with the demon king Hiranyakashipu, who forbade the worship of Lord Vishnu in his kingdom. Yet his own son, Prahlad, remained an unwavering devotee of Vishnu. Enraged, Hiranyakashipu ordered his sister Holika — who possessed a boon that made her immune to fire — to sit in a bonfire with Prahlad on her lap. By divine grace, Prahlad emerged unscathed while Holika, who misused her boon for evil, perished in the flames. This is why we light bonfires the night before Holi, a ritual called Holika Dahan, celebrating the victory of devotion over arrogance."

      "text": "Holi is also deeply associated with the divine love of Radha and Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna, feeling self-conscious about his dark complexion compared to the fair-skinned Radha, asked his mother Yashoda why Radha was so much lighter. Mother Yashoda playfully suggested he color Radha's face with whatever color he wished. Krishna did exactly that, and from this playful act was born the tradition of smearing colors. In the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh — the land of Krishna's childhood — Holi is celebrated for weeks, with the joy and abandon of the divine."

      "heading": "The Spiritual Significance of Colors",
      "text": "On a deeper level, Holi represents the dissolution of ego. When we smear color on each other, social barriers — of caste, class, age, and status — dissolve for that moment. We are all one, drenched in the same joy. The colors themselves hold meaning: red symbolizes love and fertility, yellow represents prosperity and turmeric's sacred qualities, green stands for new beginnings and nature, and blue is the divine color of Lord Krishna himself. Playing Holi is, in essence, an act of spiritual surrender — letting go of pretense and celebrating the pure joy of existence."

      "heading": "How to Celebrate Holi Meaningfully",
      "text": "On the eve of Holi, families gather around the Holika Dahan bonfire, perform prayers, and walk around the fire seeking blessings. The next morning begins with applying gulal (natural powder colors) on loved ones with the greeting \"Happy Holi!\" Traditional prasad includes gujiya (sweet dumplings), thandai, and mathri. Most importantly, use natural, herbal colors wherever possible — our skin and our environment both benefit. And remember: the truest celebration of Holi is to forgive old grudges and embrace everyone with open hearts, just as Prahlad's devotion opened the heart of the universe."
